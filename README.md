Code and data to reproduce analysis in the manuscript "Spatio-temporal variation in food conditions for lesser sandeels: species and community trait patterns from the Continuous Plankton Recorder in the north-east Atlantic".

cpr_main_script.R is the main script, which calls additional scripts in "help_scripts" to reproduce the analysis. Data files are stored in "data" and the figures created are stored in "figures".

The Stonehaven data are publicly available: https://data.marine.gov.scot/dataset/scottish-coastal-observatory-stonehaven-site

The CPR data and L4 data are not publicly available, but information on how to access them can be found here:
